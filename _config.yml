  Hi, my name's Gianmarco and I'm a PhD student in Physics at the University of Cagliari!

  My research interests include the study of the neuronal dynamcis of biological neural networks through spiking neural network simulations and mean-field approaches.
  I contribute to the GPU-based spiking network simulator NEST GPU, implementing several network models and validating the statistical measures of the neural activity against the well-known simulator NEST.
