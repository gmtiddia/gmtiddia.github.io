  Hi, my name's Gianmarco and I'm a PhD student in Physics at the University of Cagliari (Italy).
  My research interests include the study of the neuronal dynamcis of biological neural networks through spiking neural network simulations and mean-field approaches.
  I contribute to the GPU-based spiking network simulator NEST GPU, implementing several network models and validating the statistical measures of the neural activity against the well-known simulator NEST.
